## Step 1: Setup
Eventhough you probably already did this, make sure to `fork` the node-workshop repository from my github.

### First of all, we want to initialize the Node enviorment and install all of the node packages you'll be using in this workshop.

Run `npm init` in your project directory (don't worry about most of the options, for the purposes of this workshop they don't matter).

Now install all the node packages we will be using for this project ('flags', 'knock-knock-jokes', 'one-liner-jokes').

Here are links to their documentation:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/flags
https://www.npmjs.com/package/knock-knock-jokes
https://www.npmjs.com/package/one-liner-joke

Hint: `npm install --save flags` will install the 'flags' packages to your node_modules folder in your directory. the `--save` will add it to your package.json file which keeps track of your project dependencies.

## Step 2: Scaffolding the Workshop

### Create main.js, utils.js, and jokeHandler.js files in your project directory.

main.js will be the file you run in the terminal.

utils.js will contain helper functions that you will need to use in main.js

jokeHandler.js will be where you format the jokes from the two joke packages into uniform strings.

## Step 3: printing out your first jokes

### Require the both joke modules in your jokeHandler.js file.

### Then, export
